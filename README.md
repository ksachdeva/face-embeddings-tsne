# Face embeddings visualization using t-SNE

** WORK IN PROGRESS **

This is a very simple web page (WIP) that uses the [tfjs-tsne](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-tsne) to visualize the face embeddings generated using [dlib](https://github.com/davisking/dlib).

## Setup / Install / Run instructions
